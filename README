Welcome to the SubCity (former know as CityLife) project.

SubCity is a city simulation game under BSD license (see LICENSE for more informations). It will count in its features the following engines:
- economy,
- inhabitants (flows, housing renewelment, transports use, wastes management, delinquance...),
- industries (employment, economy inputs/outputs, wastes management, products avalaibility in the city, corruption...),
- energy (use, pollution....)
- transports (flows, pollution...)
- etc, your ideas are welcome too :-)

Of course, this projects is an adaptation of Sim City(tm) series. Yep that's true. But this is not a fork of Lincity. SubCity is a project written from scratch. Everything here is done by ourselves. So don't hesitate anymore, you want to discover new things in a cool project? Enroll yourself soldier!
