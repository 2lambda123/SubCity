Hello world!

Welcome and thank you to contribute to the SubCity project!

SubCity is a video-game project involving the use of bio-inspired computing, such as:
- Genetic algorithm
- Genetic programming
- Swarm-inspired agent design...

The game is now developed with C++, and uses the following libraries:
- SDL for audio and graphical interfaces
- CxxTests for tests

----- The game mechanics -----

-- General model:
The whole world the players evolve is a matrix of tiles. Each tile is a surface (water, accomodation; industry, transportation...).
Each tile has properties that when linked together create multiple set of graphs, allowing the different parameters such as economics, transportation
to evolve accordingly to the cities development.

-- Graphics structure and 
The idea is to have a game with a isometric 3d pixel art design. As there will be a maximum of 4 views, a building would be an image designed like this:

|-----------|-----------|
|			|			|
| NW view   | NE view   |
|			|			|
|-----------|-----------|
|			|			|
| SW view   | SE view   |
|			|			|
|-----------|-----------|

Where each view is the representation of the building in each possible player view.

As we want the game to be community-sensitive, the development of a file format defining sets of tiles, and moving agents is planned.
The idea is to allow constributors to create new agents with a simple description format, without having to touch the code.
